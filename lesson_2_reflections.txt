What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It becomes a git repository, that is, the git metadata is now part of the repository. This is necessary to use the file as a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different because it stores files before they are actually commited to the repo from the working directory. It allows us to be completely sure of a commit before we actually make it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By comparing the contents of the staging area and the repository using git diff --staged
